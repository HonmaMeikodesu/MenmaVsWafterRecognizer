## What to do

For a period of time I had a trouble of dividing both characters form each other since they resemble so much from the aspect of their appearances as far as I was concerned. So the idea here is simple, build up a `Convolution Neural Network` using comprehensive APIs provided by `Tensorflow`, fit a reasonable model to help differentiating <span style="color:rgb(106,130,209); font-weight:bold">Menma</span>, who is my waifu, from <span style="color:rgb(247,242,228)">Kudryavka Noumi</span> from which GAL I have never played before
